          <h2>Nature</h2>
          <p>
            Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.

          <h2>Patrika Gate</h2>
          <p>
            This is probably the most colourful I have ever seen. It is a standalone structure with several arches. The decorations and colours under the are a marvel. This place is selfie obsessed persons god sent. You can speed hours taking phots from all different angles and they will all look different.
